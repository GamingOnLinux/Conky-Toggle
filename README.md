*Last tested on January 2nd, 2019.*

This script toggles Conky's above/below line (makes it always stay on top of other windows or pushes it to background).

THIS SCRIPT ASSUMES CONKY IS ALREADY RUNNING! MAKE SURE CONKY HAS BEEN STARTED!

Download into ~/.conky/Toggle or some place sensible (doesn't really matter where).

Add to Keyboard Shortcuts by going to Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Add custom shortcut.

Name it "Conky A/B Toggle" or something similar -> Click the button next to the Command field and navigate to where ever you unzipped this file this file.

Next click on Custom Shortcuts in the left side window and click Conky A/B Toggle or whatever you named it then down below click on  one of the "unassigned" slots and then put your desired key or key-combo in there.

Congrats, you can now toggle Conky to be above all other windows or push it to the background at will without having to open a text editor!

Recommended: Pair this script up with the custom conkyrc file provided. Place the conkyrc into ~/.conky/GamingMonitor and run with ConkyMananger2.
